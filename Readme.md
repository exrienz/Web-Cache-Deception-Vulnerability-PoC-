## Evil Cache Deception PoC Exploit

This repository contains a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit that demonstrates a cache-based attack targeting a specific website. The exploit is designed to manipulate the target user's browser cache and potentially retrieve sensitive information. Please note that this repository is for educational and ethical purposes only. Do not use this code maliciously or without proper authorization.

## Exploitation Requirement

1. Vulnerable apps running on CDN (A CDN, or Content Delivery Network, is a distributed network of servers strategically located across various geographical locations) for example Cloudflare etc.
2. Caching is enabled (on CDN)
3. Same site attribute was set to "none" (by default)

### Usage

Follow these steps to use the Evil Cache PoC Exploit:

1. **Modify the Code**: Open the `poc.html` file and modify the code to include the URL of your target site. Look for the variable named `link ` and replace its value with the URL of the target site you want to perform the cache-based attack on.

2. **Upload the Code**: Upload the modified `poc.html` file to your own web hosting or server. Once uploaded, note down the URL where the file is hosted. For example, `https://yourdomain.com/poc.html`.

3. **Send the Link**: Craft a convincing message and send the link to your victim. The link should direct them to open the exploit. For example: "Hey, check out this interesting page: [Click Here](https://yourdomain.com/poc.html)".

4. **Execute the Attack**: When the victim opens the provided link, the PoC will manipulate the browser's cache settings. Specifically, it will attempt to force the victim's browser to cache the webpage `/secure/view_profile`, which will be retrieved by the attacker.

5. **Retrieve the Path**: As an attacker, you can retrieve the manipulated path as follows: `/secure/view_profile;[id].jpg`. This is the path that the victim's browser has been manipulated to cache.
